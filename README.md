# ToDo List

This todo list is a basic react application to keep track of daily activities. It includes the ability to add/edit/delete tasks, categorize into six color-coded categories, prioritize the three most important tasks, and choose which tasks need to be completed today.

### Built With

**Tech**: React, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, HTML

The base theme files in HTML with Tailwind CSS are included alongside the full React App. Used Javascript fetch (GET, PUT, POST) functionality with a mock JSON server that can easily be adapted to a backend server if built for deployment.

The categories and the name of the list are currently hard-coded to reflect my usage of the app, but a feature to add and remove categories will soon be implemented.

The project is also yet to implement the 'Dailies' page which will include a calendar to keep track of daily tasks such as exercise, medications, hygiene-related activities, etc.
